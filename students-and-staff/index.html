                <h2>Julia Mason</h2>
		<p>
Ms. Mason is currently pursuing a doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology under the supervision of Dr. Gordon Asmundson at the University of Regina in the Anxiety and Illness Behaviour Lab (AIBL), and is currently completing her pre-doctoral residency in the Clinical Health Psychology residency program in the Max Rady College of Medicine at the University of Manitoba. She received her Bachelor of Science in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Behaviour from McMaster University in 2014, graduating summa cum laude. She then received her Master of Arts in Clinical Psychology in 2017 from the University of Regina. Ms. Mason’s Master’s thesis evaluated the efficacy of sprint interval training and moderate intensity continuous training at reducing anxiety sensitivity, a vulnerability construct implicated in the etiology and maintenance of many mental disorders. Ms. Mason’s research interests are broadly focused on the treatment of anxiety and trauma-related disorders. More specifically, Ms. Mason is interested in exploring how modifiable factors such as health behaviours (e.g., exercise) and cognitive risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity) can improve the efficacy and dissemination of evidence-based treatments for ARDs. She is especially interested in the use of exercise as a treatment option for ARDs. Given her background in both psychology and exercise training (she is a certified personal trainer and yoga instructor), she is intrigued by population trends indicating that although exercise is associated with a multitude of health benefits, including anxiolytic effects, most Canadians are sedentary, especially people with ARDs. Ms. Mason has published several articles in peer- reviewed journals and presented her research at international and national conferences.

		<p>
Stephanie Korol is completing her PhD in Clinical Psychology at the University of Regina under the supervision of Dr. Nicholas Carleton in the Anxiety and Illness Behaviour Lab (AIBL). She received her Bachelor of Arts Honours in Psychology from Mount Royal University in 2012, and her Master of Science in Experimental Psychology from the University of Calgary in 2016.  She is currently completing her final residency year with the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Care Centre, with rotations in the Operational Stress Injury clinic, Forensic Assessment Inpatient Unit, and Schizophrenia Recovery Program. Ms. Korol’s research interests include risk factors underlying psychopathology, primarily in posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. Her dissertation project is investigating the link between two risk factors, intolerance of uncertainty and problematic smartphone use, and the effect of a mindfulness-based intervention in reducing these risk factors.

		<p>
Kelsey completed a Bachelor of Arts Honours degree with distinction at MacEwan University in 2015 and a Master of Arts in Clinical Psychology at the University of Regina in 2018. Her master's thesis examined associations between attention and intolerance of uncertainty.

                <p>
Zeinab received her Bachelor of Arts with High Honours in Psychology in 2014 at the University of Regina. Her honours thesis was supervised by Dr. R. Nicholas Carleton and assessed anxiety and depressive symptoms within the five factor model and HEXACO model of personality. She received the Canadian Psychological Association Certificate of Academic Excellence for her honours thesis. Zeinab went on to pursue her Master’s at Queen’s University and received her Master of Science in 2018, funded by the Joseph- Armand Bombardier Canada Graduate Scholarship. Her Master’s thesis, supervised by Dr. Cynthia Fekken, examined men’s attitudes on street and sexual harassment in relation to their personality. Zeinab is now pursuing her Doctorate in Clinical Psychology under the supervision of Dr. Carleton. Her dissertation will focus on investigating Islamophobia in Canada, focusing on trends of negative attitudes towards Muslims among the Canadian population, as well as online, and the extent Muslim Canadians have experienced Islamophobia and such effect on their mental health. Her general research interests include personality, anxiety and trauma, discrimination and harassment, and cross-cultural research.

Her master’s thesis, under the co-supervision of Drs. Gordon Asmundson and R. Nicholas Carleton, was a randomized controlled trial assessing preventive exercise on measures of anxiety-related vulnerability factors following an analogue stressor. She is fortunate to maintain co-supervision in pursuit of her PhD in Clinical Psychology.
