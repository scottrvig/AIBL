Dr. Cynthia Fekken, examined men's attitudes on street and sexual harassment in relation to their
personality. Zeinab is now pursuing her Doctorate in Clinical Psychology under the supervision of Dr. R.
Nicholas Carleton at the University of Regina. Her dissertation will focus on investigating Islamophobia in
Canada: 1) focusing on trends of negative attitudes towards Muslims among the Canadian population; 2)
the extent Muslim Canadians have experienced Islamophobia and such effect on their mental health; 3)
assess the relationship between Islamophobic attitudes, intergroup contact, intergroup disgust, and
intergroup anxiety towards Muslims; and 4) assess the effects of imagined contact tasks on Islamophobic
attitudes, intergroup disgust, and intergroup anxiety towards Muslims. Her general research interests
include personality, anxiety and trauma, discrimination and harassment, and cross-cultural research.</p>

Originally from Chicago, Rachel graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2014 with her
Bachelor of Science in Psychology with Highest Honors. Her Master&#39;s thesis under the co-supervision of
Drs. Gordon Asmundson and Nicholas Carleton was a randomized controlled trial assessing preventive
exercise on measures of anxiety-related vulnerability factors following an analogue stressor. Confirming
exercise acts as a robust tool to support mental health, Rachel designed her doctoral dissertation to
evaluate the association between exercise activity and mental health symptoms among Canadian
paramedics. The multi-methods design will help describe quantify the association between paramedics
physical health and mental health and provide qualitative data to address systemic and organizational
barriers to exercise. Rachel's commitment to increasing access to care for vulnerable individuals extends
beyond her clinical research activities. She founded and leads the University of Regina's Psychology
