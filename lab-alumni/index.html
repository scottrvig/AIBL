	    <h2>Julia Mason, Ph.D. (2021)</h2>
	    <p>
Ms. Mason is currently pursuing a doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology under the supervision of Dr. Gordon Asmundson at the University of Regina in the Anxiety and Illness Behaviour Lab (AIBL), and is currently completing her pre-doctoral residency in the Clinical Health Psychology residency program in the Max Rady College of Medicine at the University of Manitoba. She received her Bachelor of Science in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Behaviour from McMaster University in 2014, graduating summa cum laude. She then received her Master of Arts in Clinical Psychology in 2017 from the University of Regina. Ms. Mason's Master's thesis evaluated the efficacy of sprint interval training and moderate intensity continuous training at reducing anxiety sensitivity, a vulnerability construct implicated in the etiology and maintenance of many mental disorders. Ms. Mason's research interests are broadly focused on the treatment of anxiety and trauma-related disorders. More specifically, Ms. Mason is interested in exploring how modifiable factors such as health behaviours (e.g., exercise) and cognitive risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity) can improve the efficacy and dissemination of evidence-based treatments for ARDs. She is especially interested in the use of exercise as a treatment option for ARDs. Given her background in both psychology and exercise training (she is a certified personal trainer and yoga instructor), she is intrigued by population trends indicating that although exercise is associated with a multitude of health benefits, including anxiolytic effects, most Canadians are sedentary, especially people with ARDs. Ms. Mason has published several articles in peer- reviewed journals and presented her research at international and national conferences.	    </p>

            <p>Lydia was as a postdoctoral fellow under Dr. Gordon Asmundson's supervision from 2010 to 2013. She received her Bachelor's of Psychology in 2004, and her Master's of Research in Clinical and Health Psychology in 2007, both at the University of MÃ¡laga (Spain). Her Master's thesis focused on psychological variables predicting chronic pain patients' adjustments to pain condition and treatment outcome perception. She was awarded a FPU (â€œFormaciÃ³n de profesorado
            Universitarioâ€) doctoral fellowship of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Sciences to complete a doctoral research program in the Department of Personality, Assessment and Psychological Treatment of the University of MÃ¡laga. In May of 2010, she received her PhD. Her dissertation research examined differences in pain sensitivity between non-PTSD trauma- exposed individuals, trauma exposed individuals with a probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
            non-trauma-exposed individuals. Her research with Dr. Asmundson explored the comorbidity between PTSD and chronic pain, and the mutual maintenance of both disorders, as well as the potential influence of traumatic experiences over the pain system.</p>
