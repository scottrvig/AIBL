            <h2><b>Current Research</b></h2>
            <h3 style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px">Exposed to trauma and looking for treatment?</h3>
            <p>A CIHR-funded project being conducted by the Anxiety and Illness Behaviour Lab at the University of Regina is inviting individuals between the ages of 18 and 65 years who have encountered traumatic events and subsequent distress and impairment to participate in a study examining ways to increase the effectiveness of treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
            <p>The front-line treatment for PTSD today is cognitive behavioral therapy, a variant of which is prolonged exposure therapy, which involves safely and gradually confronting stimuli which cause stress and fear within the security of a therapy session. As effective as this type of therapy is, we are curious of ways to make things better for clients. A recent development has shown that aerobic exercise can reduce PTSD symptoms (see <a
                href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24911173">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24911173</a> for a brief description). Since we know that both aerobic exercise and prolonged exposure can help persons affected by PTSD, we want to see if combining the two is as effective, or more effective, than either one alone.</p>
            <p>The current research involves persons receiving in-person treatment at the University of Regina Anxiety and Illness Behaviors Laboratory for 12-weeks. This service would cost between $2000 and $2600 if obtained through community practice and would typically require persons to be on a waitlist for services for up to 6 months; however, this treatment is offered at the Anxiety and Illness Behaviors Laboratory free and is available immediately for those who are eligible. Our
            services are provided by trained therapists and supervised by Drs. Gordon Asmundson (R.D. Psych.) and R. Nicholas Carleton (R.D. Psych.). Services are confidential and your privacy and safety is taken very seriously. Please note that services offered through this study are not intended for legal or insurance purposes.
            PTSD is real, it’s serious, and it’s treatable!</p>

            <h3>Experience anxiety in social situations? Participate in self-help treatment</h3>
            <p>We invite you to participate in a Canadian Institutes of Health Research-funded treatment
            study examining the efficacy of a self-compassion training program if you experience anxiety in
            social settings. Self-compassion training involves learning how to be kind and compassionate
            towards oneself instead of harshly judging oneself and being overly self-critical about personal
            failings or social shortcomings. Research suggests self-compassion training is effective at
            improving psychological well-being and may be particularly helpful for individuals with social
            anxiety.</p>
            <p>Participation in this research includes independently working through a weekly session of self-
            compassion training or applied relaxation via the Internet for 6 weeks, practicing daily
            exercises, and completing questionnaires via the Internet. These programs are completed in the
            comfort of your home and will teach you skills to help manage your anxiety.</p>
            <p>For more information about this study and to determine whether you might be eligible to
            participate please follow the link below:</p>

            <h3>Were you a victim of bullying and are still bothered by that experience?</h3>
            <p>Bullying victimization is directly associated with various longstanding mental health difficulties, but no comprehensive victim-tailored interventions exist that explicitly target the impact of bullying. Evidence from both neurobiological and psychological research suggests that victims experience bullying as trauma. Treating the distress associated with bullying victimization as trauma may, therefore, be beneficial.</p>
            <p>In this doctoral dissertation project we are comparing a specific trauma based treatment called Cognitive Processing Therapy to general treatment and a waitlist condition. This aims of this study are to a) develop an effective treatment for victims of bullying that is also flexible, accessible and affordable, and b) examine the risk and resilience factors associated with persisted distress from bullying victimization.</p>
            <p>Participants in this study receive 12 sessions of free online therapy. They are supported through weekly contact with trained therapists supervised by Dr. Gordon Asmundson (R.D.Psych). Services are offered through the secure web server of the University of Regina Online Therapy Unit and are confidential. Protecting your privacy and safety is taken very seriously.</p>
